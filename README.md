When starting a new app, site or just little demo I always clone this repo. 

It is inspired by HTML5 boilerplate but I removed some parts i don't use and added a few things: 

- Sass & Compass
- Grunt
	* Concat
	* JS Hint
	* Livereload
	* Watch
	* UglifyJS
- Config.rb for Compass
- Personal humans.txt
- PHP Extensions

The upcoming month I hope to add a few things:
	
- [ ] Gzipping 
- [ ] HTML5 Shiv  
- [ ] Some more .htaccess stuff
- [ ] Init this gist: https://gist.github.com/arthurvr/11006683
- [ ] Favicon stuff
- [ ] Gitignore file
- [ ] JSHint config file
